# Dillinger Bower

Dillinger is an excellent NON-embeddable Markdown editor.

The Dillinger's fork https://github.com/paulocheque/dillinger will try to turn the Dillinger embeddable. **But no expressive progress so far.**

This current project is a Bower project that will use that fork to provide the Dillinger editor as a Bower dependency.


# Testing it locally

    make
    open example.html


# Installation

This Bower lib has not been registered in Bower yet, because this is an experiment.
